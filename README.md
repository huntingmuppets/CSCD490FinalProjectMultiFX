# Multi-FX Plugin

## Motivation
- One way to enhance an audio project is to use effects to shape the sound.
- Sometimes users find themselves using multiple effects on a single track which can lead to multiple disorganized effect windows.
- Although there are already multi-fx plugins in the market, such as Logic Pro x built-in multi-fx or Transit by Baby Audio, they tend to be already fixed in effect placement or cost hundreds of dollars.
- Our mission with this multi-fx plugin is to provide a simple easy-to-use multi-fx plugin that allows users to mix and match effects and is completely free.

## Installation Guide
